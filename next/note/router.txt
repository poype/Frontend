In Next.js we have a built in router that is based on the file system.
To make route publicly accessible, we have to put a special page file in that folder.
Only page.tsx file is publicly accessible.

Beside page.tsx file, we have some other special files for router.
layout.tsx file for defining a common layout for pages.
loading.tsx for showing loading UIs.
route.tsx for creating APIs.
not-found.tsx for showing custom errors.
error.tsx for for showing general custom error pages.
